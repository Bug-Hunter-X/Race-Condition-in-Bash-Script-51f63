This repository contains a simple bash script that demonstrates a race condition bug.  The script creates two files and launches two processes that simultaneously write to those files. Due to the race condition, the final content of the files is unpredictable and demonstrates the need for proper synchronization mechanisms in concurrent programming. The solution demonstrates using flock to avoid this.
